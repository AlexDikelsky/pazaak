Pazaak is a card game from the game series "Knights of the Old Republic." 
The game is simular to Blackjack, however instead of playing to 21 points, you play to 20.
In addition, you have a 'hand' that you can use to add to your total.

SETUP:
Run the game
Type in the card values from your hand. I suggest choosing 1 for each card, although any number less than 20 can work

PLAY:
1. Draw a card from the deck (1-10)
2. Play (or don't) a card from your hand
3. Either repeat from step 1 or stand

If you get over 20 points, you can play a negative card from your hand, or you lose.
